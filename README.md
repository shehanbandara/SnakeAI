# SnakeAI
A Reinforcement Learning AI Agent That Learns how to Play Snake, The Classic Atari Game.

## Theory: ##
- **Reinforcement Learning** is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.<br />
- **Deep Q Learning** extends reinforcement learning by using a deep neural network to predict actions.<br />
